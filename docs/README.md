# Installation Guide

This guide describes how to install CORD. It identifies a set of
[prerequisites](prereqs/README.md), and then walks through
the steps involved in bringing up one of two CORD profiles:

* [R-CORD](./profiles/rcord/install.md)
* [M-CORD](./profiles/mcord/install.md)

If you are anxious to jump straight to a [Quick Start](quickstart.md)
procedure that brings up an emulated version of CORD running
on your laptop (sorry, no subscriber data plane), then that's an option.

Alternatively, if you want to get a broader lay-of-the-land, you
might step back and start with an [Overview](overview.md).
