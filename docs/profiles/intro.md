# Bringing Up CORD

CORD is a general-purpose platform that is able to run one or more
profiles, each of which includes some access technology (e.g., OLT,
RAN) and some collection of services (called a service graph or
service mesh).

Although in principle arbitrarily many different profiles are
possible, and profiles can be dynamically extended with new services
at runtime, each release of CORD includes a collection of reference
profiles. This section describes two.
