# Prerequisites

The latest release of CORD decouples setting up the deployment environment from
installing CORD. This means more prerequisites must be satisfied (as enumerated
in this section), but doing so provides more latitude in how you prep a POD to best
match your local environment.

There are three categories of requirements that must be met before installing CORD:

* [Hardware Requirements](hardware.md)
* [Connectivity Requirements](networking.md)
* [Software Requirements](software.md)
