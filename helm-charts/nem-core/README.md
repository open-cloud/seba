# NEM Core Charts

The helm charts contained in this directory are sufficient to deploy the SEBA
control plane, which is otherwise known as NEM (Network Edge Mediator).
Some of these charts (e.g., `kafka`) are included "by reference" because they
are maintained externally to SEBA.

> **TODO:** Include XOS charts by reference rather than by value.
